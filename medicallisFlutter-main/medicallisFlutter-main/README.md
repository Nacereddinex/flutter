who are we and what are we trying to do  
Convallis, located at Pfarrkirchen is a mobile application intended for elderly people and non-professional caregivers who manage a lot of medications on a daily basis and need a way to organize them.


innovative solutions are imperative today to help solve a few of the problems that family Caregivers encounter, it is recognized that being an informal caregiver is strenuous, expensive and leads to the risk of poorer mental ( Sallim et al., 2015) and physical health  ( Capistrant et al., 2012) and eventually leading them to burnout.  Burnout is defined as a tridimensional syndrome in response to chronic stress by (Maslach et al., 1996).


Our aim is Help these caregivers manage the overwhelming amounts of tasks they have, so that we can reduce Caregiver stress, and potentially burn-out. And finally allow Care Receivers to live at home comfortably among their family members, as long as possible.


In Germany 3.3m – 5.2m people who work and provide care for a loved one, 3 – 4 hours spent on care daily 40% – 60% suffer from burnout or depression. The financial loss for companies is 14.000 EUR / year  for each caregiver employee is 55bn €/year in Germany 260bn $/year 







Convallis wants to help with: 

-Caregivers continuous education
-helping caregivers in obtaining the medication : with showing  possible pharmacies near them 
-Preparing: create the daily Medication plan, set reminders, 
-Administering: help caregivers learn more about how to give medication, injections, drops, inhalers, ointments, changing bandages. by providing educational content 















functionalities that we decided for our product: 


-medication reminder notifications :  provide notification for the caregiver for the times of the medication, along with information about the medication, 
the notifications can be scheduled daily and weekly, information such as dosage, notes can be saved with each medication for more flexibility. 


-Data base:  SQFLITE local database is the best option for an application  because we are handling information, that is only relevant to the particular client (https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

-creating deleting and showing reminder for each day : we want the caregiver to enter the app and see the medication reminders for each day he selects for him to be able to anticipate when to give medications


-scanning prescription: we want to help the caregiver save time, by allowing him to take a picture of the prescription only  instead of typing all medication information by hand. It can be either taking a picture of importing an image from the gallery directly.
